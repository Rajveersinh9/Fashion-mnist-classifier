# 🧠 Fashion MNIST Image Classifier

This project builds a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras to classify grayscale fashion item images from the Fashion MNIST dataset. It demonstrates practical applications of image preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and prediction interpretation.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

- Trained a deep learning CNN model to classify images into 10 fashion categories
- Used Matplotlib to visualize input samples and prediction outputs
- Applied preprocessing with PIL and NumPy to prepare real images for testing
- Evaluated model performance and interpreted softmax probability outputs

---

## 📊 Use Case Relevance

This project simulates unstructured data analysis using machine learning. It demonstrates:
- Working with image-based data (unstructured inputs)
- Training and evaluating models using statistical and visual tools
- Presenting model results in a clear, interpretable format
- Exposure to real-world AI use cases aligned with data-driven decision-making and audit intelligence
